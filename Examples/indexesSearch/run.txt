# The genetic dataset here was created using EPISEARCH/Examples/RProcessing/preprocessing.R
# The indexing file was created using the Python script at EPISEARCH/srcf/findIndices.py

#The following code will run through the indices in the 4th line of the index file. That is,
# i,j,k = (6,48,54) to  (9,17,53). This is useful for array jobs since we can just set the
# -ndindex option via an environment variable to iterate through the whole set.
